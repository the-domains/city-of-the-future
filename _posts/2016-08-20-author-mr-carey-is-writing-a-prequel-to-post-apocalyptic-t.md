  Great news for fans of M.R. Carey's The Girl With All the Gifts-a book that's
  about to enjoy a higher profile once the movie adaptation is out this fall.
  Carey announced he'll be writing another tale set in the same world, with the
  interesting twist that it'll be a prequel, rather than the expected sequel.
