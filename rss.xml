            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>George Orwell Explains in a Revealing 1944 Letter Why He'd Write 1984</h1><p>Most of the twentieth century's notable men of letters - i.e., writers of books, of essays, of reportage - seem also to have, literally, written a great deal of letters.

Carey's The Girl With All the Gifts-a book that's about to enjoy a higher profile once the movie adaptation is out this fall.
